# 🛡️ FINANCIAL SENTINEL: AGENTIC RAG ENGINE
### **Enterprise-Grade Multi-Agent Orchestration for Global Regulatory Compliance**

---

## 🚀 Executive Overview
**Financial Sentinel** is an elite **Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** system, specifically engineered for FinTech giants and global brokerages operating within volatile regulatory landscapes. 

Unlike traditional RAG systems that merely retrieve and summarize, the Sentinel functions as an **Autonomous Auditor**. It leverages a sophisticated network of intelligent agents that don't just find data—they perform critical reasoning, identify jurisdictional deltas (e.g., ESMA vs. ASIC), and deliver precise, risk-mitigated intelligence ready for final legal review.

## 🛠️ Advanced Technology Stack & LLM Ops
Built upon **Anti-Fragile Systems Design** principles, focusing on extreme precision and a strict zero-hallucination policy.

* **Core Engine:** Agentic RAG Architecture (Multi-step Reasoning Loops).
* **Orchestration Platform:** **Coze** (Advanced Multi-Agent Workflows).
* **Intelligence Layer:** **GPT-4o** & **Gemini 1.5 Pro** (Dual-model cross-verification).
* **LLM Ops Framework:**
    * **Automated Evaluation:** Integrated self-correction layer that validates every response against the source Knowledge Base (Grounding).
    * **Prompt Engineering:** Senior-level system instructions featuring integrated **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** reasoning.
* **Deployment:** Live **Telegram Bot** interface for instant regulatory audit access.

## ✨ Key Architectural Features

* **Autonomous Jurisdictional Reasoning:** Independently analyzes and flags regulatory differences across multiple regions (EU, Australia, Cayman Islands).
* **Truth-Source Anchoring:** 100% reliance on verified PDF documentation from official regulatory bodies.
* **Conflict Resolution Agent:** A specialized agent that identifies contradictions between international and local financial mandates.
* **Agentic Evaluation Layer:** Before output generation, the system performs internal fact-checking to ensure 100% data integrity (**LLM-as-a-Judge** methodology).

## 📈 Future Scalability & Roadmap

* **Real-time Risk Blocking:** Integration with trading APIs to automatically halt non-compliant transactions.
* **Cross-Industry Adaptation:** Scalable architecture for Healthcare (HIPAA), GDPR, and ESG frameworks.
* **Enhanced Observability:** Future integration with **AgentOps** for deep-trace monitoring of agentic behavior.
